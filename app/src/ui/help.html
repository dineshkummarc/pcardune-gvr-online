      <h3>The Five Primitive Guido van Robot Instructions:</h3>
      <pre>
    move
    turnleft
    pickbeeper
    putbeeper
    turnoff
      </pre>

      <h3>Block Structuring</h3>
      <p>
        Each Guido van Robot instruction must be on a separate line.  A sequence of
        one or more Guido van Robot instructions that are all indented the same
        number of spaces compose a <strong>block</strong> of code. &nbsp;
        <code>&lt;instruction&gt;</code> refers to any of the five primitive
        instructions above, the conditional branching or iteration instructions below,
        or a user defined instruction.
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
    &lt;instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;
      ...
    &lt;instruction&gt;
      </pre>


      <h3>Conditional Branching</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Conditional branching</strong> refers to the ability of a program to
        alter it's <strong>flow of execution</strong> based on the result of the
        evaluation of a <strong>conditional</strong>.  The three types of conditional
        branching instructions in Guido van Robot are <code>if</code> and
        <code>if/else</code> and <code>if/elif/else</code>.  &nbsp;
        <code>&lt;test&gt;</code> refers to one of the eighteen conditionals below.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
    if &lt;test&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;

      </pre>

      <pre class="code">
    if &lt;test&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;
    else:
        &lt;block&gt;

      </pre>

      <pre class="code">
    if &lt;test&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;
    elif &lt;test&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;
    ...
    elif &lt;test&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;
    else:
        &lt;block&gt;
      </pre>


      <h3>Conditionals</h3>
      <p>
        GvR has eighteen built-in tests that are divided into three groups: the
        first six are wall tests, the next four are beeper tests, and the last
        eight are compass tests:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
    front_is_clear
    front_is_blocked
    left_is_clear
    left_is_blocked
    right_is_clear
    right_is_blocked

    next_to_a_beeper
    not_next_to_a_beeper
    any_beepers_in_beeper_bag
    no_beepers_in_beeper_bag

    facing_north
    not_facing_north
    facing_south
    not_facing_south
    facing_east
    not_facing_east
    facing_west
    not_facing_west
      </pre>


      <h3>Iteration</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Iteration</strong> refers to the ability of a program to repeate an
        instruction (or block of instructions) over and over until some condition is
        met.  The two types of iteration instructions are the <code>do</code> and
        <code>while</code> instructions. &nbsp;
        <code>&lt;positive_number&gt;</code> must be an integer greater than 0.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
    do &lt;positive_number&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;

      </pre>

      <pre class="code">
    while &lt;test&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;
      </pre>


      <h3>Defining a New Instruction:</h3>
      <p>
        New instructions can be created for Guido van Robot using the
        <code>define</code> statement.  &nbsp; <code>&lt;new_name&gt;</code> can
        be any sequence of letters or digits as long as it begins with a letter and is
        not already used as an instruction. <strong>Letters</strong> for Guido van
        Robot are A..Z, a..z, and the underscore (_) character.  Guido van Robot is
        case sensitive, so TurnRight, turnright, and turnRight are all different names.
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
    define &lt;new_name&gt;:
        &lt;block&gt;
      </pre>


      <h3>Simplest GvR Program</h3>
      <p>
        Execution of a GvR program ends with the <code>turnoff</code> instruction.
        Any program which reaches the end of its instruction sequence without
        encountering <code>turnoff</code> is considered in error.  Thus the simplest
        GvR program is:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
    turnoff
      </pre>

      <h2>More ways to learn GvR</h2>
      <p>
        The GvR language was originally defined by Jeff Elkner and
        implemented as a Desktop application which is now very mature
        and stable.  It runs on all major platforms including Windows,
        Mac OS X and Linux.  You can find more information about the
        desktop application on the GvR website
        at <a href="http://gvr.sourceforge.net">http://gvr.sourceforge.net</a>.
        There is also a series of 18 structured lessons for learning
        GvR and programming concepts in general.  You can find the
        lessons here:
